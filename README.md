Ônibus BH
========

Bus routes are fundamental information for users when planning their way through the city. Reading and understanding the routes, which are usually presented as tables with street names, is a difficult task. In this work, we present a method aimed at retrieving the route’s geometry based on its table and the city’s road network, which allows viewing the route on a map. Using the proposed method, we developed a web application for the city of Belo Horizonte
